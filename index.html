            <h2><strong>But who is Elon Musk?</strong></h2>
                <p>Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.

                At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.
                At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.</p>

                <p>In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.
                After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.
                He currently holds three citizenships (South Africa, Canada & United States)</p>

                <p>Elon Musk is an engineer and technology entrepreneur. He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer/designer of SpaceX; CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. 
                He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018. In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People, and was ranked (co-)first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019. 
                He has a net worth of $31.7 billion and is listed by Forbes as the 40th-richest person in the world. He is also the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.

            <p><h2>So what exactly has Elon Musk accomplished so far?</h2></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>1995: Zip2, online city guides</strong> - Musk’s first Web software company, founded with his brother using money loaned by their father, was aimed toward helping the newspaper industry put together ‘city guides’ for online users. After considering, and ultimately rejecting, a merger with CitySearch (IACI), Zip2 was bought by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk received $22 million from the sale.</li>
                    <br/>
                <li><strong>1999: X.com (PayPal) e-payments</strong> - In 1999, Musk co-founded a company called X.com, which focused on financial services and email payments. A year later, X.com merged with Confinity and adopted the name of that company’s best-known service, PayPal. The two technologies created a powerhouse that led the way in online payments, which was eventually bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Musk pocketed $165 million from that deal.</li>
                    <br/>
                <li><strong>2002: SpaceX</strong> - Musk’s aerospace company may be just as famous as his automobiles. Founded in 2002 to help reduce the cost of space transportation and enable the colonization of Mars, SpaceX’s Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets are designed to be reusable. The company has flown six cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station and has been awarded a contract by NASA to develop a spacecraft to take crew members to and from the ISS.</li>
                    <br/>
                <li><strong>2003: Tesla Motors</strong> - These days, it’s impossible not to think of Musk without quickly thinking of Tesla, the publicly traded electric-car company whose stock has increased nearly 700 percent in the last 2.5 years</li>
                    <br/>
                <li><strong>2006: SolarCity</strong> - Co-founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins, SolarCity has since grown to become the second-largest provider of solar-power systems in the country, with revenues of $102.8 million in the most recent quarter.</li>
                    <br/>
                <li><strong>2013: Hyperloop</strong> - Musk’s latest idea might be his most ambitious. This transportation system, introduced in 2013 and still in the formulative stages, aims to allow commuters to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes or less — faster than a commercial flight.
                    The rail system would work in a tube with extremely low air pressure, which would theoretically reduce drag and enable higher speeds at up to 800 miles per hour with lower power consumption. That full vision is still a long way from reality, though.</li>
                    <br/>
                <li><strong>TBC: Electric Jet</strong> - Musk hasn’t officially started working on this project, but last year at MIT’s Aeronautics and Astronautics Centennial Symposium, he said he was “toying” with the concept. Musk also has mused on The Colbert Report about the opportunity to have a “vertical takeoff and landing electric supersonic jet,” which uses electric motors to drive a fan, which in turn propels the aircraft.</li>
            </ol>

            <br/>

            <p> <strong>Lastly before you go, here is some more random information for you:</strong>
                </br>
                Before he popularized electric cars and began planning the colonization of Mars, Musk was a kid who liked video games. 
                So, at the age of 12, he made his own. That’s impressive enough, but Musk being Musk, he sold the game to a magazine for roughly $500. 
                Curious what the pre-pubescent inventor put together? You can play a Web-based version of Blastar today. <a href="http://blastar-1984.appspot.com/" target= "_blank">Click here to play Blastar</a><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
